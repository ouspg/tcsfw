# ETSI EN 303 645 V2.1.1 (2020-06)
# The present document specifies high-level security and data protection provisions for consumer IoT devices that are
# connected to network infrastructure (such as the Internet or home network) and their interactions with associated
# services. The associated services are out of scope [HOX].

# "associated services": digital services that, together with the device, are part of the overall consumer IoT product and that
# are typically required to provide the product's intended functionality
# EXAMPLE 1: Associated services can include mobile applications, cloud computing/storage and third party
# Application Programming Interfaces (APIs).

# Concepts:
# IoT device
DEVICE = (Claims.HOST.local() - Claims.host_type(HostType.BROWSER, HostType.MOBILE)).name("IoT-device")

# Network service in a device
