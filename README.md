This project is proof-of-concept _Tool-driven security assessment_ (TDSA) framework created for research. 
The quality is not up to real world use, but perhaps this can acts as inspiration for some. (The name is acronym from _Transparent Cybersecurity Framework_, which is name used for this in a research paper, but I have moved on with the name and it is TDSA now).
